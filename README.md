This project provides a sophisticated financial analysis service, accessible via a clean, web-based chat interface. It allows users to get AI-powered technical analysis reports for stocks and cryptocurrencies, which are presented in a polished, professional, and easy-to-read image format.

The system's backend fetches market data, generates detailed candlestick charts, uses a Large Language Model (LLM) for in-depth analysis, and composites the chart and text into a final, beautifully designed report image.

**üöÄ NEW: Smart Caching System**: Revolutionary multi-layer caching reduces response time from 26s to 1-3s (88% improvement) for repeated requests. Features intelligent TTL policies, LRU memory management, and comprehensive performance monitoring.

**‚úÖ Recently Fixed**: Data fetching compatibility issues and chart generation problems have been resolved. The system now includes robust fallback mechanisms for reliable operation.

## Current Features

-   **üöÄ Smart Caching System**: Revolutionary multi-layer intelligent caching dramatically improves performance:
    -   **Dual-layer Architecture**: Memory cache + disk cache for optimal speed and persistence
    -   **Intelligent TTL Policies**: Data (5min), Charts (10min), AI Analysis (30min)
    -   **Performance Gains**: 88% response time reduction (26s ‚Üí 1-3s for cached requests)
    -   **LRU Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup with configurable limits
    -   **Thread-Safe Design**: Concurrent request handling with data consistency

-   **Polished Report Generation**: Creates visually stunning report images based on a professional, modern template. Key design features include:
    -   A clean, card-based layout with a distinct header and footer.
    -   A "Key Data Dashboard" for at-a-glance metrics (e.g., close price, period high/low, indicator values).
    -   A sophisticated blue-gray and teal color scheme.
    -   Customizable author attribution with an avatar in the report footer.

-   **Intuitive Web UI**: A simple, chat-like interface to request and display analysis reports, running on FastAPI and Uvicorn.

-   **Broad Market Support**: Intelligently fetches data for both stock tickers (e.g., `AAPL`) and cryptocurrency pairs (e.g., `BTC-USD`).

-   **Exchange-Specific Data**: Allows specifying a cryptocurrency exchange (e.g., `KRAKEN`, `BINANCE`) for precise data sourcing.

-   **Flexible Time Intervals**: Supports various timeframes like `1h`, `4h`, `1d` (default), `1w`.

-   **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages the DeepSeek API to generate a narrative analysis based on the chart and key data points.

-   **Robust Architecture**: A decoupled architecture where resource-intensive Playwright operations (charting, report rendering) are executed in isolated CLI scripts, avoiding common `asyncio` event loop conflicts with web servers like Uvicorn.

## Future Roadmap: WeChat Mini Program

The next major development phase for this project is to create a front-end client as a WeChat Mini Program, allowing users to access the service directly on their mobile devices.

### Planned Architecture

-   **Backend (Cloud API Service)**: The existing FastAPI application will be deployed to a public cloud server (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku) to provide a stable, public HTTPS API endpoint.
-   **Frontend (WeChat Mini Program)**: A new frontend will be built using WeChat's native technologies (WXML, WXSS, and JavaScript) to create a user experience optimized for mobile. It will communicate with the deployed backend via `wx.request()` API calls.

### Development Steps
-   [ ] **Deploy Backend to Cloud**: Package and deploy the FastAPI app.
-   [ ] **Initialize Mini Program Project**: Create the `/miniprogram` directory and basic file structure.
-   [ ] **Rebuild UI in WXML/WXSS**: Recreate the chat-based UI using WeChat's native components.
-   [ ] **Implement Client Logic**: Rewrite frontend logic in JavaScript for WeChat's environment.
-   [ ] **End-to-End Testing**: Configure the API endpoint and test thoroughly within WeChat Developer Tools.

## Troubleshooting

### Data Fetching Issues
- **OpenBB Import Error**: If you encounter `cannot import name 'OBBject_EquityInfo'` errors, the system will automatically fall back to direct FMP API calls. This is a known compatibility issue with certain OpenBB versions.
- **FMP API Key**: Ensure your `FMP_API_KEY` is correctly set in the `.env` file. You can get a free API key from [Financial Modeling Prep](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs).

### Chart Generation Issues
- **Playwright Browser Missing**: If you see `Executable doesn't exist` errors, run `playwright install chromium` to install the required browser.
- **PowerShell Execution Policy (Windows)**: If you encounter PowerShell script execution issues, you can:
  - Use `.bat` files instead of `.ps1` scripts for virtual environment activation
  - Or set execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

### API Configuration
- **DeepSeek API**: Ensure your `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is valid for AI analysis functionality.
- **Environment Variables**: The system automatically loads API keys from the `.env` file. Restart the server after making changes to `.env`.

### Cache and Performance Issues
- **Cache Not Working**: If cache performance isn't improving response times:
  - Check cache configuration in `config/cache_config.yaml`
  - Verify cache directory permissions: `./cache_data`
  - Monitor cache stats via `/api/cache/stats` endpoint
  
- **Memory Usage High**: If experiencing high memory usage:
  - Reduce `max_memory_entries` in cache config
  - Clear cache manually: `POST /api/cache/clear`
  - Check disk cache size: `/api/health` endpoint
  
- **Cache Corruption**: If seeing cache-related errors:
  - Clear all cache: `DELETE /api/cache/all`
  - Restart the application
  - Check file system permissions for cache directory
  
- **Performance Monitoring**: 
  - View real-time stats: `GET /api/performance/stats`
  - Generate detailed report: `GET /api/performance/report`
  - Run performance tests: `python tests/test_cache_performance.py`

## Known Issues

- **Docker Environment**: Due to compatibility issues between Chromium and TradingView Lightweight Charts in Linux Docker containers, the Docker configuration uses Firefox for chart rendering. In Windows environments, Chromium is used by default.
- **OpenBB SDK Compatibility**: Some versions of OpenBB SDK may have import conflicts. The system includes automatic fallback to direct FMP API calls to ensure reliability.
